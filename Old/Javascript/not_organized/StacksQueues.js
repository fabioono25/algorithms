//Stacks - browser history
//we can use Arrays or Linked Lists (both are going to work very well)

//Arrays: cache locally - technically faster to access in memory - double memory when the limit is almost reached


//Linked Lists: over memory - more dynamic memory



//Queues

//Arrays: NEVER USE - when we remove first, we must shift the entire items to the correct index (unshift - O(n))

//Linked Lists: prefered - we just need to move the HEAD (O(1)) - constant
