//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//BFS: start seanrching the closest nodes to the parent first


//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
//BFS: DFS will take a long time in this type of situation


//If the tree is very wide:
// DFS: BFS will need to much memory - track all the nodes in the levels


//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS


//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS


//Finding the shortest path:
//BFS
