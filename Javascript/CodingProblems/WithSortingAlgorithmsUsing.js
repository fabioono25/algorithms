//#1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:

//it's small and simple - Intertion Sort - easy to code - space complexity O(1)



//#2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount:

//Radix or Counting sort (it's a number to 1 - 1000) - fixed length of integers


//#3 - Sport scores on ESPN

//quick sort: most efficient - scores mostly sorted - for merge sort can be too much


//#4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data

//merge sort: we're not sorting in memory - worried about performance - O(n log n)


//#5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews

//Insertion sort: assuming that mostly of previous data is already sorted - for preorder is good


//#6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada

//Radix or Counting if no decimals places
//otherwise QuickSort


//#7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random.

//Merge Sort or Quick Sort (if not too worried about worst case - don't forget to pick a good pivot)


//#8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time

//Bubble sort and selection sort
