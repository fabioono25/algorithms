    * Row of n houses, each can be painted in red, blue or green. the cost for each house is different. 
    * Paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
    * cost is represented by n x 3 cost matrix. Ex: costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red.
    * costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green and so. Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
    * input[[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]], output: 10
    * (paint house 0 in blue, house 1 in green, house 2 in blue - mincost: 2+5+3=10)
